### Hi, my name is Marcus.

I'm a programmer from Canada with experience in Java, C++, and Rust.

[//]: # (I'm particularly interested in build tooling &#40;buildscripts&#41; and compilers.)

You probably know me from [Galacticraft](/projects/galacticraft) (or, maybe you know me IRL).

I've been programming for many years now,
mainly in Java where I have written multiple JavaFX applications and modifications for Minecraft. 

I have also written command line applications and a web service backend using Rust,
and have worked with embedded C++.
