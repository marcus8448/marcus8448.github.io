# About

I started to contribute to Galacticraft (4) through issue/bug reports in 2017 and pull requests in 2018.
In 2019, I was invited to work on Galacticraft 5 (called Galacticraft: Rewoven at the time) and have worked on it since then.

As a member of the international team creating Galacticraft 5, I have:

* Implemented a graph-based wire network (power distribution) system
* Created an extensible framework for making machines (see [MachineLib](/projects/MachineLib))
* Ported many pieces of content
  * Noise and world generation code
  * Blocks, items, tools
  * Entities
* Made rockets, planets and galaxies extensible and data driven
* Kept the project up to date with upstream api changes

# Features

* Explore the solar system in your own spaceship!
* Support for custom rocket parts and planets via datapacks
* Manage machines that use electricity
* Manage oxygen systems to sustain life in space
* Custom ores, tools, structures, items and blocks to aid your journey to the stars
