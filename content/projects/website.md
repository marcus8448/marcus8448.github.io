# About

My original website (2020) was generated using a single handwritten template with Jekyll.
It had a basic navbar and not much else.
I used Jekyll because it was the native site generator for GitHub pages.

In 2021, I decided to revamp the website.
This time I used [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) to style the page,
and proper templating to generate the content and layout (e.g., iterating over project pages to generate the index).

In 2023, I replaced Jekyll with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for templating and generation.
I decided on Hugo for its strong templating, fast speed, and simple setup.
This time I tried to focus on making the website responsive, rather than solely desktop-oriented.

The current website (as of 2025) now uses TailwindCSS rather than Bulma.
Due to the extensive use of CSS variables in Bulma 1.0 (released 2024), the size of the project grew to over 100KB, minimized.


The majority of the icons used on the site are from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) 
and [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome).
