My original website (2020) was generated using a single handwritten template with Jekyll.
It had a basic navbar and not much else.

In 2021, I decided to revamp the website.
This time I used [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) to style the page,
and proper templating to generate the content and layout (e.g., iterating over project pages to generate the index).

The current website (2023) now uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the site instead of Jekyll.
I decided on Hugo for its strong templating, fast speed, and simple setup.
This time I tried to focus on making the website responsive, rather than desktop-oriented.

The majority of the icons used on the site are from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) 
and [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome).
